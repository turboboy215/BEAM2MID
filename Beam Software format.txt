Song channel patterns table
===================
Each channel has its own series of patterns referenced by a pointer table that are joined together with their corresponding sequences of the same number to make up a full song or sound effect.

To find the locations of each pointer table, the following code is seen:
ld a, c
rlca
ld e, a
ld a, [$????]
ld hl, Ch1PatTable
add hl, de
add [hl]
jr ?
ld a, c
sub a, $04
rlca

Note that the order of the channels is not necessarily equal to the audio channels they are mapped to; these are determined by the instruments.

Which equals the following in hex:
79 07 5F FA xx xx 21 ?? ?? 19 86 18 0D 79 D6 04 07

Sequence data
===================
The sequences referenced are different for each song/sound effect, but is shared by all channels. Two pointers are used to look for the sequence data referenced by the song channel pattern: one for the location of each sequence relative to the start of the data, and the other the start of the sequence data for a song itself.

The pointers can be found using the following code:
rlca
ld [$????], a
ld e, a
ld d, $00
ld a, $00
ld [rNR51]
ld hl, SeqData
add hl, de
ldi a, [hl]
ld [$????], a
ld a, [hl]
ld [$????], a
ld hl, SeqPtrs
add hl, de
ldi a, [hl]
ld [$????], a

Which equals the following in hex:
07 EA xx xx 5F 16 00 3E 00 E0 25 21 ?? ?? 19 2A EA xx xx 7E EA xx xx 21 ?? ?? 19 2A EA xx xx

Song channel patterns
===================
Patterns for each channel are structured as follows:
00 = Stop song
01 xx = Play pattern
02 xx = Go to song loop
03 xx yy = Play pattern X, Y times

Sequence format
===================
Sequences are structured with the following commands:
xx yy (x = 00-7F) = Play note, length (0 = rest)
(To get note length, mask off the lower five bits from the byte (use AND operation to 00011111), and then add to the base value of the note length table.) 
xx (80-F9?) = Switch to instrument number (also affects play channel)
FF = End of sequence

Note length table
===================
The following table is used to calculate the note length for at least some, or possibly all games:
03 06 09 0C 12 15 18 24 2A 30 48 54 60 90 A8 02 03 04 06 07 08 0C 0E 10 18 1C 20 30 38 FF FE FD FB F7 EF DF BF 7F 01 02 04 08 10 20 40 80

Song tempos
===================
The song tempo table is accessed using the following code:
rlca
rlca
rlca
rlca
ld hl, $????
or [hl]
xor a, $FF
ld hl, $????
and [hl]
ld [hl], a
ld hl, Tempos

Which equals the following in hex:
07 07 07 07 xx xx C1 B6 EE FF 21 xx xx A6 77 21 ?? ??
